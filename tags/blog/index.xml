      <description>A few days ago I ported my blog to hugo. I did this mostly while staying inside Emacs and switching to the web browser every now and then.
 Doing this required me to use Emacs to edit and manage multiple files at once and this post demonstrates few of these techniques. The post is therefore mostly task agnostic and the techniques explained here should be usable for any such tasks.</description>

      <description>I recently acquired umarahmad.xyz and moved my old blog there.
 The earlier version of this blog was based on octopress with a lot of handcrafted code. The architecture of octopress along with my excitement of setting up the blog made this a cocktail of all possible plugins and tweaks that I could manage to squeeze into a static site. Copy pasted rake snippets and hacked together web and ruby code gave me what I wanted at the time.</description>
