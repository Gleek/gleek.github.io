Hello, I&#39;m Umar.</p>
<p>

I was one of the starting members of the online ordering team there and have contributed to building and scaling systems to serve millions of customers daily.</p>

<p>
This is my personal blog where I aim to regularly share insights into my learning journey. This will mostly be around computers and technology with perhaps some other genres of life as well.</p>
<p>
Many posts on this blog are about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. I spend a large portion of my time on a computer inside it, whether I&#39;m writing, reading, coding, or just organizing my work.</p>
<p>
As a typical Emacs user, I regularly end up in the rabbit hole of refining my configuration: trying a new package, tweaking a workflow, or shaving off a bit of friction, only to revisit it again later.</p>
<p>
This has caused me to spend a significant amount of time customizing it and learning a few things in the process.</p>
<p>
Hopefully, this blog will contain some of these learnings.</p>
<p>
