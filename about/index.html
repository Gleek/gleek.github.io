Hello, I&#39;m Umar.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m currently based in Bangalore, India and working in <a href="https://www.zomato.com">Zomato</a>, a food delivery company and <a href="https://www.zomato.com/investor-relations">more</a>. I was one of the starting members of the online ordering team there and have contributed to building and scaling systems to serve millions of customers daily. More details about my work can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmadumar/">linkedin</a></p>

<p>
This is my personal blog where I aim to regularly share insights into my learning journey. This will mostly be around computers and technology with perhaps some other genres of life as well.</p>
<p>
Many of the posts on this blog are about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. This is primarily because a very large portion of my time on a computer is spent inside of it.</p>
<p>
As a typical Emacs user, I regularly fall into the rabbit hole of refining my customization to my satisfaction only to be unsatisfied with it in sometime.</p>
<p>
This has caused me to spend a significant amount of time customizing it and learning a few things in the process.</p>
<p>
Hopefully, this blog will contain some of these learnings.</p>
<p>
