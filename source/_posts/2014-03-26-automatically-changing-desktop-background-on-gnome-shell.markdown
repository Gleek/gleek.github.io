One of the main attractions about a system is the desktop background. We tend to choose our background which identifies our interests , are aesthetically pleasing or remind us of our good times.

But the thing with consistency is that it gets boring with time. Wallpapers we once loved, becomes a burden and we find it hard to come back to that wallpaper after getting it on 24Ã—7.

This is the problem I had. I cancelled out each wallpaper from my list of all wallpapers I had, after I completely sucked out the goodness of a wallpaper with my eyes.

I came up with the idea of automatically changing the wallpaper randomly via some sort of shell script. It's implementation used <code>gsettings</code> to change the desktop wallpaper. It was supposed to run automatically as a cron-job but I couldn't make the cron work. The current implementation uses <code>sleep</code> to get the delay

So a simple wall paper changing script looked like:

```bash

#!/bin/bash
image_path=$1
#Setting up a path for local storage

if [ ! -d "$image_path" ]; then
  echo "Path doesn't exist (Pass absolute path as parameter)" 1>&2
  exit
fi
local_dir="/home/$(whoami)/.local/wall_change"
#creating local directory
mkdir -p $local_dir
#getting name of the picture
pic=$(find $image_path -regextype posix-extended -regex "(.*\.jpg)|(.*\.png)"|shuf -n1)
echo $pic

#Storing image in local_dir
filename=$(basename "$pic")
extension=".${filename##*.}"
local_wallpaper=$local_dir/mywallpaper$extension
#setting the wallpaper
cp "$pic" $local_wallpaper
#echo $local_wallpaper
#Adding bogus wallpaper (don't know if this is a gsettings bug or i'm doing some basic flaw)
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:/$local_wallpaper
#try increasing the sleep if wallpaper doesn't change
sleep 1;
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file://$local_wallpaper

```
