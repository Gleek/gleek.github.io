I am Umar, an engineer (atleast 3/4th, as of now) and an open-source enthusiasts. I love to learn new technologies and share it with people. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor-Degree in Computer Engineering from [Jamia Millia Islamia](http://www.jmi.ac.in).
I see myself as a geek who his amazed by the wonders and marvel of technology.
I'm also a part of an Open-Source society [JMI-LUG](http://www.jmilug.org) because of my admiration for the FOSS culture.
I blog with a selfish reason to log software development ,my thoughts and my works, which I can easily refer back later.

You can find me on [![Github](/images/github_alt.png)](https://www.github.com/gleek) and <a href="https://profiles.google.com/103949851787406544998?rel=author" rel="author">Google+</a>
