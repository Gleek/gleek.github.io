PHP mode in emacs sadly has <a href="https://github.com/emacs-php/php-mode/issues?q=slow++OR+performance++OR+latency">slow performance</a> for large files. In my work, I have to sometimes deal
with large PHP code bases and in certain cases, it becomes so slow that it is practically useless
for me to use php-mode. I grudgingly have to switch to <code class="verbatim">fundamental-mode</code> to make smaller changes, in
that case. There are alternatives like <code class="verbatim">web-mode</code> that is better suited for mixed syntax highlighting
with files containing multiple web languages but there are other php-mode goodies like support for
different coding styles and better indentation that make it worthy enough to not be discarded
completely.</p>
<p>
I recently decided to deep dive into the performance issues of PHP and found syntax highlighting
being the primary reason for slowness. To solve for it I eventually ended up removing the complete
syntax highlight code and replacing it with <a href="https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter">tree-sitter</a>. This made highlighting much faster and
reduced the latency considerably in writing larger files.</p>
<p>
This is what I ended up doing to achieve that:</p>
<div class="src src-elisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#111">(</span><span style="color:#111">advice-add</span> <span style="color:#d88200">&#39;php-syntax-propertize-function</span> <span style="color:#111">:override</span> <span style="color:#75af00">#&#39;</span><span style="color:#111">return-false</span><span style="color:#111">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#111">(</span><span style="color:#111">advice-add</span> <span style="color:#d88200">&#39;php-syntax-propertize-extend-region</span> <span style="color:#111">:override</span> <span style="color:#75af00">#&#39;</span><span style="color:#111">return-false</span><span style="color:#111">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#111">(</span><span style="color:#111">remove-hook</span> <span style="color:#d88200">&#39;syntax-propertize-extend-region-functions</span> <span style="color:#75af00">#&#39;</span><span style="color:#111">php-syntax-propertize-extend-region</span><span style="color:#111">)</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Here the <code class="verbatim">return-false</code> is a small utility function and is defined as follows:</p>
<div class="src src-elisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#111">(</span><span style="color:#111">defun</span> <span style="color:#111">return-false</span><span style="color:#111">(</span><span style="color:#00a8c8">&amp;rest</span> <span style="color:#111">_</span><span style="color:#111">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#d88200">&#34;Return nil no matter what the inputs here.
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#d88200">Useful to override functions to become empty&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#00a8c8">nil</span><span style="color:#111">)</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
The tree sitter configuration is as follows</p>
<div class="src src-elisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#111">(</span><span style="color:#111">use-package</span> <span style="color:#111">tree-sitter</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#111">:ensure</span> <span style="color:#111">tree-sitter</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#111">:ensure</span> <span style="color:#111">tree-sitter-langs</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#111">:defer</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#111">:config</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#111">(</span><span style="color:#111">add-hook</span> <span style="color:#d88200">&#39;tree-sitter-after-on-hook</span> <span style="color:#75af00">#&#39;</span><span style="color:#111">tree-sitter-hl-mode</span><span style="color:#111">))</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
For the sake of comparison my typing latency reduced from 600ms-2500ms to 35-50ms. This is closer to
<code class="verbatim">fundamental-mode</code> where I get around 20-25ms of typing latency in the same file.</p>
<p>
The actual syntax highlighting has slight differences.</p>
<p>
Before:</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/php-highlight-sans-tree-sitter.png" alt="/images/php-highlight-sans-tree-sitter.png" title="/images/php-highlight-sans-tree-sitter.png" /></p>
<p>
After:</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/php-highlight-tree-sitter.png" alt="/images/php-highlight-tree-sitter.png" title="/images/php-highlight-tree-sitter.png" /></p>
<p>
As is evident from the screenshots, the <code class="verbatim">tree-sitter</code> provides slightly more consistent syntax
highlighting by correctly highlighting the function names in a single color. A clear drawback is the
missing doc-block syntax highlight, which the tree-sitter highlighter has ignored as comment.</p>
<p>
It might make sense for php-mode to adopt tree-sitter as the primary syntax highlight system and
some effort can be diverted there in order to improve the syntax highlighting from
tree-sitter. Integration with tree-sitter might also become a standard for major modes once there is
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pxpq8d/rfc_emacs_treesitter_integration/">native tree-sitter support in Emacs</a>. But, until that time, using hacks like this would solve for
such issues.</p>
