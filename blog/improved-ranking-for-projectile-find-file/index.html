<p>
I&#39;ve been using <code class="verbatim">projectile</code>, and more recently <code class="verbatim">counsel-projectile</code>, to
manage my project files and it has been a life saver.
<code class="verbatim">projectile-find-file</code> is probably among my most used commands.</p>
<p>
Despite my fondness for this package, a thing that has bothered me is
the default sorting of the files while searching. As the project
becomes larger and the files become sparse, some extra typing needs to
be done to filter down to the intended file.</p>
<p>
This post explores an improvement which should make the experience of
searching for files better by providing a more relevant list of files.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Why not use <code class="verbatim">counsel-fzf</code>?
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
There are packages that integrate external searching tools such as
<code class="verbatim">counsel-fzf</code>. They usually provide better ranking than the out of the
box experience from projectile. These can work asynchronously and are
also faster than any native emacs implementation.</p>
<p>
Therefore, <code class="verbatim">counsel-fzf</code> alone should be sufficient for most people unhappy with
the default search ranking in projectile.</p>
<p>
That being said, I&#39;ve a few reasons for not using fzf</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-2">
fzf is not specifically built to search files
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Even though, arguably, fzf is mostly used to filter a large list of
files, it is not specifically built for it. It
will work the same way when provided with any arbitrary list.</p>
<p>
This feature of fzf limits the optimizations that could have been
made for the specific problem of searching filenames.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
fzf lacks context
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>fzf, like any other external tool, lacks the context from inside
Emacs. It isn&#39;t aware of the recent files or the buffers that are open.</p>
<p>
Integrating these might be possible but certainly not easy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-4">
fzf has fuzzy search
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This might be an unpopular opinion, but I don&#39;t think fuzzy searching is
superior to it&#39;s alternatives.</p>
<p>
Fuzzy search would seem much faster than it&#39;s alternatives in
filtering down the lists in theory. But, at least for me, in practice
I&#39;ve always been able to filter more quickly and reliably when using
the default ivy filtering.</p>
<p>
Fuzzy search works roughly by adding <code class="verbatim">.*</code> after every character
whereas the ivy works by substituting the space with <code class="verbatim">.*</code></p>
<p>
So searching for <code class="verbatim">search term</code> would expand to <code class="verbatim">s.*e.*a.*â€¦</code> for a
generic fuzzy searching algorithm but <code class="verbatim">search.*term</code> for ivy.</p>
<p>
Fuzzy searching algorithms usually do have a scoring system which
makes them do their magic but nonetheless, predicting this magic is
hard. Many a times I see no correlation between the input and the
results without really trying to find it.</p>
<p>
Also, as is obvious from the regex, fuzzy search would return a
super-set of what a normal ivy search would, so you&#39;re almost always
dealing with more results.</p>
<p>
Even when a fuzzy searching system is built specifically to search
files and has the context, it might not work as intended. Issue queue
of VSCode, for example, has multiple examples of it failing for
users(<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/2705">such</a> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/99171">as</a> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103889">these</a>).</p>

<h2 id="headline-5">
Adding a ranking system
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Considering ivy already provides a good searching framework, what we
need is a good ranking system.</p>
<p>
A generic search ranking system works by giving a <em>score</em> to each search
element which can then be used to sort the results.</p>
<p>
A basic scoring system could give scores on these factors</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Static factors
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>These factors are such that they are not affected by the search term
but can be derived from the file.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Buffer files</strong>: If a file in the project is currently open thereâ€™s a
high chance that Iâ€™m searching for this file. The older the buffer
gets the less score boost it should get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recent files</strong>: If a file in a project has been recently visited that
should contribute to increasing itâ€™s score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Length of file path</strong>: Considering a file with a longer path can
afford more characters to get filtered, a file with shorter path
should get a better score.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-7">
Dynamic factors
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The scores due to these factors vary with the search term</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>File non-directory name match</strong>: If the non-directory name of the file
exactly matches the search term then it gets a score
boost. Eg. <code class="verbatim">file.ext</code> in <code class="verbatim">path/of/file.ext</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File basename match</strong>: If the basename of the file exactly matches the
search term then it gets a score boost. Eg. <code class="verbatim">file</code> in <code class="verbatim">path/of/file.ext</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File prefix match</strong>: If the prefix of the file basename  matches with the
search term then the score is increased. Eg. <code class="verbatim">fi</code> in <code class="verbatim">path/of/file.ext</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File name loose match</strong>: If the file name loosely matches the search
term then give it a higher score than when only directory name
matches. Eg. <code class="verbatim">ile</code> in <code class="verbatim">path/of/file.ext</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As you might have guessed, these are ordered here in decreasing order
of their scores.</p>
<p>
Considering the nature of the factors, only the best matching dynamic
factor is chosen while choosing all the static factors while scoring.
The reasoning for this is purely intuitive.</p>

Few considerations
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The code above depends on <code class="verbatim">counsel-projectile</code>, but it is not a hard
requirement. I only add it to provide few extra actions on the
files. Those actions can be removed to remove that dependency.</p>
<p>
Most of the users should be well off with <code class="verbatim">(setq
projectile-completion-system &#39;ivy)</code> anyway.</p>
<p>
Iâ€™d just mention that even though this code has worked well for me on
my projects and in my workflow, I havenâ€™t tested it specifically outside of
my usage. Also, considering that the code has evolved just before this
post, Iâ€™d suggest the user be ready to tackle a few bugs in their usage.</p>
<p>
Also note that the scores for each of the factor is completely intuitive and is not
backed by data. Feel free to modify them. They should be easily
modifiable by changing the variable defined on top of the linked file.</p>
<p>
To completely replace counsel-projectile with this add this snippet:</p>
<div class="src src-elisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp">(advice-add <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;counsel-projectile-switch-project-action</span> :override <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;counsel-projectile-switch-project-action-find-file</span>)
(advice-add <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;counsel-projectile-find-file</span> :override <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;+projectile-find-file</span>)</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
To get file icons if you have <a href="https://github.com/asok/all-the-icons-ivy">all-the-icons-ivy</a> installed, add this:</p>
<div class="src src-elisp">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp">(eval-after-load <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;all-the-icons-ivy</span>

Future improvements
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
There are multiple improvements that I can think of already.</p>
<p>
These havenâ€™t bothered me enough to actually solve for them right
now. I might work on them later and update the code in my config
accordingly.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-16" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-16">
Asynchronous running
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Thereâ€™s a slight lag when listing a considerably large project
files.</p>
<p>
An implementation I can think of is using emacs-async to populate the
file list in a separate buffer and running a timer to transfer the
content to ivy.</p>
<p>
I can think of few other similar hacks, each with caveats of their own. Iâ€™m
not sure if thereâ€™s a way to achieve this in ivy natively.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-17" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-17">
Ranking exact subword match higher
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Search terms matching subwords inside files should rank higher. An
example of subword can be <code class="verbatim">file</code> in <code class="verbatim">myFile</code> / <code class="verbatim">my-file</code> / <code class="verbatim">my_file</code> etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-18" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-18">
Handling spaces in search query
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-3">
<p>All the dynamic factors for scoring are pretty much useless if the
user adds space to their search query. Handling those to match
subwords or directory names should improve the ranking further.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-19" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-19">
Adding prescient.el as a scoring factor
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-3">
<p><a href="https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el">Prescient.el</a> is an effective enhancement to all your completing-read
frameworks by ranking them in descending order of their usage. It
works by scoring the recently used elements higher than the elements
that were chosen earlier. This score can be incorporated in the total
score as a static factor, to get even better results.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-20" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-20">
Making it easier to add new scoring factors
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The scoring factors are embedded in the code and thereâ€™s no easy way
to add new ones. This is not an issue now considering the few factors
we have currently, but this might have to be done to make this generic
enough for other people to use it.</p>

<h2 id="headline-21">
Outro
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-21" class="outline-text-2">
<p>As I said earlier, this code has worked great for the few projects I
had but hasnâ€™t been tested extensively. Please treat it likewise.</p>
<p>
This has only been possible because of the work of people like
<a href="https://metaredux.com/about/">Bozhidar</a> and <a href="https://oremacs.com/about/">Oleh</a>. They both have had immense contribution to the
emacs community. Please consider donating through the links on their
respective websites, if you feel likewise and are able to.</p>
