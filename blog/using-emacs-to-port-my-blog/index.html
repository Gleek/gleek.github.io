A few days ago <a href="/blog/setting-up-the-blog-again">I ported my blog to hugo</a>. I did this mostly while
staying inside Emacs and switching to the web browser every now and
then.</p>
<p>
Doing this required me to use Emacs to edit and manage multiple files
at once and this post demonstrates a few of these techniques. The post
is therefore mostly task agnostic and the techniques explained here
should be usable for any such tasks.</p>
<p>
This is in no way a comprehensive post for porting any blog to
hugo and I&#39;ve deliberately skipped steps that were either too
straightforward to perform or used a technique that I&#39;ve already
covered in doing something else. For a more detailed understanding of
the process, please refer to <a href="https://retifrav.github.io/blog/2019/03/17/migrating-from-octopress-to-hugo/">this</a> blog post by someone else.</p>
<p>
For the sake of brevity Iâ€™ll only cover these topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up the environment, i.e., setting up the directory
structure, git repositories and tooling.</li>
<li>Port my markdown files so that they work with hugo</li>
</ul>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Setting up the environment
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Hugo is a static site generator that works by converting the
&#34;content&#34; files written in many of the formats it supports, such as
markdown or org into a set of html files.</p>
<p>
It uses a simple layout system mainly comprising of single pages and
list pages to save the developer any repetitive work by reusing
components across multiple places.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-2">
Installing hugo
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p><code class="verbatim">system-packages</code> package makes it possible to install any package from
within emacs.</p>
<p>
Pressing <code class="verbatim">C-c P i</code> bound to <code class="verbatim">system-packages-install</code> and
typing hugo in the minibuffer installs it using your preferred package
manager.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
Setting up the directories and repositories
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I planned on having two repositories for the blog. One would be the
source repository having hugo files and the other would be for the
generated html.</p>
<p>
I usually do directory operations from inside <code class="verbatim">dired</code> but I feel
<code class="verbatim">counsel-find-file</code> is more intuitive when creating new files, in
different locations.</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">C-x C-f</code> bound to <code class="verbatim">counsel-find-file</code></li>
<li>Type in <code class="verbatim">blog/blog-src</code> followed by <code class="verbatim">C-M-o</code></li>
<li><code class="verbatim">d</code> to create a directory</li>
<li>Type in <code class="verbatim">blog-gen</code> and <code class="verbatim">M-o</code> then <code class="verbatim">d</code> again to create another directory
and quit to ivy buffer</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how it looks in practice:
<video autoplay loop controls class="video">
    <source src="/videos/create-directories.mp4">
</video>

<p class="video-fallback">Click <a href="/videos/create-directories.mp4">here</a> to download or view the video in a full browser window</p>
</p>
<p>
Initializing repositories can be done via <code class="verbatim">magit</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">C-x m</code>  bound to <code class="verbatim">magit-status</code> a directory will create a
repository if one does not exist already and open magit-status buffer</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">M a</code> from there adds a remote and fetches it</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">b c</code> checkouts a new branch from another branch</li>
</ul>
<p>
After setting up the environment I can start porting my blog there.</p>

Porting content files from old blog
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Moving my files from octopress to hugo required a few minor
transformations to happen.</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">2014-02-19-hello-blogging.markdown</code> to be renamed to <code class="verbatim">hello-blogging.md</code></li>
<li>Adding <code class="verbatim">aliases</code> to maintain the older links working</li>
<li>Fixing invalid markdown that was valid in the older spec</li>
<li>Removing few unnecessary meta tags from the header files</li>
</ul>
<p>
These need to happen on every file.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Bulk renaming
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p><code class="verbatim">dired-mode</code> and <code class="verbatim">wdired</code> are great for such tasks. Wdired makes any
directory list editable like any other file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening the dired buffer and pressing <code class="verbatim">W</code> to switch to wdired</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">C-x h</code> to select all the lines followed by <code class="verbatim">C-n</code> to limit it to the only files</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">C-S-c C-S-c</code>  bound to <code class="verbatim">mc/edit-lines</code> to get a cursor on every line.</li>
<li>Edit the files names accordingly and <code class="verbatim">C-c C-c</code> to save the changes to disk.

This is how it looks in practice:
<video autoplay loop controls class="video">
      <source src="/videos/wdired-multi-rename.mp4">
  </video>
  
  <p class="video-fallback">Click <a href="/videos/wdired-multi-rename.mp4">here</a> to download or view the video in a full browser window</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Updating meta
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p><code class="verbatim">aliases</code> provide a way for hugo to create multiple links for one single
post. The path for posts in my older blog was in
<code class="verbatim">year/month/day/blog-title</code> format. There&#39;s a way to do this for <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#permalinks-configuration-example">all
posts in hugo</a>, but I only wanted to retain this format for the older posts
and would be happy with <code class="verbatim">/blog/blog-title</code> format that hugo uses by default.</p>
<p>
To do this I use the <code class="verbatim">date</code> field in the header of the octopress
markdown files. These can be manipulated to create the date
<code class="verbatim">year/month/day/</code> part in the <code class="verbatim">aliases</code> field. The <code class="verbatim">blog-title</code> can be
derived from the file name, by writing some lisp code and running
<code class="verbatim">eval-and-replace</code> (custom function in my config). Macros can then be
used to do the same for all the files</p>
<p>
Macros in emacs allow an edit to replicated any number of times after
recording them once. If we open the first file from dired, make the
necessary changes and switch back to the dired buffer, we can make
emacs do the change for all the files sequentially with just a single
keystroke.</p>
<p>
A demonstration may give a better idea</p>
<p>
<video autoplay loop controls class="video">
    <source src="/videos/macro-multi-file-edits.mp4">
</video>

<p class="video-fallback">Click <a href="/videos/macro-multi-file-edits.mp4">here</a> to download or view the video in a full browser window</p>
</p>
<p>
This can be followed by running <code class="verbatim">C-c p s</code> bound to
<code class="verbatim">projectile-save-project-buffers</code> to save all the modified buffers</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-7">
Fixing invalid spec
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>One of the few incompatibilities in the markdown spec was how
markdown handled headings. Earlier</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>#H1#
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>##H2##
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>###H3###
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>####H4####
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>#H1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>##H2
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>###H3
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>####H4</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
were considered valid markdown headings which
now had to be changed to</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span># H1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>## H2
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>### H3
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>#### H4</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This again needs to be done across all the files.</p>
<p>
Macros can be used here as well but macros can quickly get complex
considering the keystrokes should be generic enough to work with all
the files. I instead used a feature in emacs which allows me to search
for terms from across multiple files and edit them in a single buffer,
as if I&#39;m editing a single file. Emacs can then cleverly apply those
changes to the original files.</p>
<p>
I did this by:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">C-u C-c s s</code> bound to <code class="verbatim">counsel-rg</code> to search through the current directory</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">C-c C-o</code> bound to <code class="verbatim">ivy-occur</code> to get the search results in a buffer</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">w</code> bound to <code class="verbatim">ivy-wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode</code> makes the buffer editable</li>
<li>Editing them and running <code class="verbatim">C-c C-c</code> to save these changes</li>
</ul>
<p>
To keep this simple it is done twice once to remove the preceding <code class="verbatim">#</code> and once to remove the following <code class="verbatim">#</code></p>
<p>
This is how it looks:</p>
<p>
<video autoplay loop controls class="video">
    <source src="/videos/rg-occur-wgrep-edit.mp4">
</video>

<p class="video-fallback">Click <a href="/videos/rg-occur-wgrep-edit.mp4">here</a> to download or view the video in a full browser window</p>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

Conclusion
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>These steps allowed me to have a working hugo blog with all the posts
ported from the older blog system.</p>
<p>
As I mentioned earlier, the purpose of this post was not to be a
comprehensive guide of porting to hugo but instead a demonstration for
how these tasks that might have required writing complex
shell scripts or doing repetitive effort were done easily from within emacs.</p>
<p>
Emacs provides other ways to manage multiple files together as
well. Dired, LSP, Projectile can all be used to manage multiple files
at once in ways not covered in this post and each demanding an article
on it&#39;s own. I therefore, only covered the features that I used in this
particular task.</p>
<p>
My emacs configuration can be found <a href="https://github.com/Gleek/emacs.d">on github</a> for people who are interested
in replicating some of the features described here.</p>
